📌Good programming practices are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code. 
  Here are some important principles to follow:

1. Maintain consistent indentation, line spacing, and naming conventions.

2. Instead of tabs, use 4 spaces for indentation.

3. Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities. This improves code clarity and reduces the 
   need for excessive comments.

4. Do not use non-ASCII characters in function names or any other identifier.

5. Wherever required, use comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.

6. Use spaces around operators and after commas.

7. Insert blank lines to separate functions and classes, and statement blocks inside functions.

8. Use document strings that explains the purpose of the function.

9. Name of the functions should be in lowercase with underscores to separate words (like student_info).

10. Name of the classes should be written as ClassName(like StudentInfo).

11. Implement proper error handling mechanisms. Use try-catch blocks or similar constructs to gracefully handle exceptions and errors.

👉🏻 Use version control systems like Git to track changes to your code over time. This allows you to collaborate effectively, revert to 
   previous states, and manage different versions of your codebase.
